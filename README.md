the vacant featherweight championship. The event will be held on April 12, 2025, at the Kaseya Center in Miami, Florida.
Alexander Volkanovski:
Age: 36
Ex-UFC Featherweight Titleholder
A man known for his durability, fight IQ, and well-rounded skill-set.
Sept 9, 2023: Lost featherweight title to Ilia Topuria (Feb. 2024)
Seeking the title back and to reestablish his superiority in the weightclass.
This is on the heels of a knockout defeat to Islam Makhachev late in 2023. Besides these downfalls, Volkanovski is amongst the most waged and hungry fighters available in the UFC’s featherweight ranked.
Diego Lopes:
Age: 30
Fifth: Rising contender on five-fight win streak
Known for its aggressive striking and high-level submissions.
Recent wins include a unanimous decision over former title challenger Brian Ortega back in September 2024.
Lopes is one of the most dangerous and diverse competitors in the featherweight division, and this matchup is an interesting clash of styles.
The winner of this matchup will not only claim the featherweight championship but will also help shape the direction and flavor of the division going forward. Many fans regard Volkanovski as a clear favorite behind his experience and prior championship reign, but Lopes’ momentum and well-rounded skill set make him a strong threat.
